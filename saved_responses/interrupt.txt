Yes, I see that you have implemented a push-to-talk system using the `keyboard` library to detect key presses and releases. To allow the user to interrupt the AI while it's speaking, you can modify the `play_audio_from_queue` function to stop playing audio when the push-to-talk key is pressed. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. Add a global flag `is_interrupted` and a lock `is_interrupted_lock` to manage the interrupted state:

```python
is_interrupted = False
is_interrupted_lock = threading.Lock()
```

2. Create a function to set the `is_interrupted` flag:

```python
def set_interrupted(value):
    global is_interrupted
    with is_interrupted_lock:
        is_interrupted = value
```

3. Modify the `play_audio_from_queue` function to stop playing audio when the `is_interrupted` flag is set:

```python
def play_audio_from_queue():
    global is_playing
    while True:
        audio = audio_queue.get()
        with is_playing_lock:
            is_playing = True

        # Modify this part
        xi_stream(audio, on_chunk_played=lambda: set_interrupted(False) if is_interrupted else None)

        if audio_queue.qsize() == 0:
            with is_playing_lock:
                is_playing = False
        audio_queue.task_done()
```

4. Register a new hotkey in the `get_voice_input` function to set the `is_interrupted` flag when the push-to-talk key is pressed:

```python
# Register key press and release events
keyboard.add_hotkey(hotkey, start_recording, suppress=True)
keyboard.add_hotkey(hotkey, stop_recording, trigger_on_release=True, suppress=True)
keyboard.add_hotkey(hotkey, lambda: set_interrupted(True), suppress=True)  # Add this line
```

5. Don't forget to unregister the hotkey after the recording is done:

```python
# Unregister key press and release events
keyboard.remove_hotkey(start_recording)
keyboard.remove_hotkey(stop_recording)
keyboard.remove_hotkey(lambda: set_interrupted(True))  # Add this line
```

Now, when the user presses the push-to-talk key while the AI is speaking, the audio playback should be interrupted.
