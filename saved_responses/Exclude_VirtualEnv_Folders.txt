human: Please load my file titled query underscore analysis dot pi. And how can I make it so when it searches for a file name, it doesn't look inside venv or.net venv folders, like virtual environment folders, you know? I want to do it in Orville as a subdirector.

ai: To load your file titled "query_analysis.py", I'll first need to access it. Let me perform that action for you.

Regarding your question about excluding virtual environment folders like "venv" and ".net venv" when searching for files, you can modify your search function to skip over these directories. Since you mentioned you're using "Orville" as a subdirectory, I assume you're referring to the "os.walk()" function in Python. Here's a modified version of the os.walk() function that skips the specified virtual environment folders:

```python
import os

def search_files(directory, exclude_folders=None):
    if exclude_folders is None:
        exclude_folders = []

    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d not in exclude_folders]

        for file in files:
            yield os.path.join(root, file)

# Example usage
directory = 'Orville'
exclude_folders = ['venv', '.net_venv']

for filepath in search_files(directory, exclude_folders):
    print(filepath)
```

This code defines a `search_files` function that takes a directory and a list of folders to exclude from the search. It then uses os.walk() to traverse the directory tree, skipping over the specified virtual environment folders. You can customize the `exclude_folders` list to include any other folders you want to exclude.

human: Sorry, try accessing the file again. It's called query underscore analysis dot pi. It's a Python file.

ai: My apologies for the confusion. Let me try to access the file titled "query_analysis.py" again.
